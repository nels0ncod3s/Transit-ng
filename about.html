      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Naija Transit Guide</strong> — a platform built to
        help passengers in Nigeria navigate unfamiliar routes easily. Whether
        you’re new in town or simply exploring, our goal is to give you reliable
        directions and transport tips from real people who know the road.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in the power of community. With your help, we crowdsource
        verified routes so no one gets lost or overcharged again.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Lagos to Kano, from bus stops to hidden shortcuts — we’re mapping
        Nigeria together.
